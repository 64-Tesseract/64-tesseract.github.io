            <p>I usually program random things for fun, and usually they don't grow to become completed games or tools. If, however, I end up half-completing a project that's cool or useful, I'll put it here!</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Learning Bash was a bit of an adventure for me - so somehow I ended up coding the classic Snake game for a terminal window in it!
                    <p>This is one of the easier half-completed games to run, due to it being written in an interpreted language. You may open <code>snake_menu.sh</code> for a simple "GUI" settings screen, and when you're ready you can press space to jump into the game!
                    <p>However, Bash isn't terribly efficient when it comes to writing interactive scripts, let alone handling large arrays, so it may slow down a bit.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Inspired by the first FPS games, such as Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, I present: a terminal-based non-euclidean maze exploring simulator, proudly written in C!
                    <p>Players can move a character by holding <b>one</b> of the WASD keys, and turn with J and L. You can venture through character-based hallways looking for poorly-anti-aliased items and getting lost in looping rooms. It's got customizable speeds, a variable FOV between 0 and 360 degrees, and decent wall collision detection. The screen even has a fancy head bob!
                    <p>Of course, it's not perfect - what could you expect from my second C project? The rendering can flicker sometimes, whether it's from the rendering thread being slow or rays moving through portals weirdly; and it's a pain to use, since maps are read from <code>.txt</code> files and <code>ncurses</code> isn't good with keyboard presses... but for a proof-of-concept, it's a pretty cool gimmick, I think.</p>

                    <p>For a long time, I was struggling to find a nice wallpaper for my phone. There was a pattern I took a liking to, though; it was a website background that simulated floating points that connected to others nearby, filling the shapes they made with a gradient. I tried looking for something similar, but the closest thing I could find was <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxelus.colorslivewallpaper">Symphony of Colors</a>, though I wasn't 100% happy with it. After discovering <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsignlabs.apde">APDE</a> - a Processing port for Android - I tried to recreate what I saw, but I couldn't get it to look right.
                    <p>Thus, I decided to come up with my own unique pattern. At the time I was into pixel art, so after experimenting with Perlin noise, I ended up with a kind-of "flowing lava" or "energy" look. Unfortunately, my code was unorganized and confusing, so I couldn't upload it for others.
                    <p>It was only recently that I decided I should publish this, and after lots of trial and error, I managed to recreate what I had made in an organized way. It uses the <code>data/layers.json</code> file to get information on layers, where each layer's <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Brightness, Alpha">HSBA</abbr> channels have their own Perlin noise pattern. This lets users create nice-looking patterns without having to clumsily edit the source code.</p>

                <h3><del>Life Story</del> Description</h3>
                    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://powdertoy.co.uk">The Powder Toy</a> is the legendary sandbox game in which players can create all sorts of things, anywhere from nukes to electronics. I made some functional computers, and though it's not a "programming" project, I still decided to include it here. Electronics in TPT follow a set of simple rules, and realizing I knew how to use most of these mechanics, I decided to challenge myself to create a system that imitates computers.
                    <p>Thus was born the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainf***</a> Interpreter - using large cells to keep track of numbers and a clunky machine to move between them, this computer could handle basic IO, addition/subtraction, and nested loops... But, it had a horribly slow speed with everything it did and amazingly poor accuracy when outputting numbers.
                    <p>TPT also has a mechanic where binary numbers (up to 30 bits) may be sent via filters and ray emitters. Deciding to create a computer with filters, I ended up with a huge, poorly organized mess that could perform many numerical operations. It also had bigger & better memory, plus a longer ROM tape, though it was still slow, and it had a very weird language.
                    <p>After this, I have created one more computer. This one took up much less space, and was a bit faster. However, being based off a theoretical minimal CPU instruction set, it lacked many features to be useful. Also, while this computer had double the RAM the previous one did, the program is stored in the same space, meaning it can be overwritten.
                    <p>For my last 2 computers, I have also made a "machine-code" compiler in LUA that manages <code>GOTO</code> tags, automatically encoding pixels. My new goal is to create a computer with "subframe" technology, exploiting the update order of pixels to create incredibly fast mechanisms.</p>
