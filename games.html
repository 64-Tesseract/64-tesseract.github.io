            <h2>My Games</h2>
            <p>While programming minor projects for fun, I might come up with an idea that would work well as a proper game... Or I might just have spent too much of my time on an obscure project!
            <p>Either way, here is a list of games that are published for the public to enjoy.</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Bounce-a-Meteor is an arcade/survival game that slowly gets faster as you play. In the game you are tasked with protecting planet Earth from an endless meteor storm using the most inefficient and ridiculous defense system: Giant trampolines!
                    <p>By spinning the whole planet around, you need to make sure the space rocks land on the trampolines instead of Earth for as long as you can. Sometimes, you will see helpful anti-matter meteors which scientists on Earth can use to repair the planet, or if hit by normal meteors, cancel each other out and leave less for you to worry about!
                    <p>(Please keep in mind, Bounce-a-Meteor was my first game made in Unity, so it lacks polish - also, it shows an ad every other time you lose, so it's not open-source or anything...)</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>TetrisColour (originally named CrappyTetris, before the colour update) is a lightweight Tetris clone with a simple interface. It was written in the Java-like <a target="_blank" href="https://processing.org">Processing IDE</a> environment during my time at highschool, primarily out of boredom.
                    <p>The controls are customizable, but default to the arrow keys for movement and Z/X for rotation. There is a small variety of pain-inducing colour schemes, but by editing the <code>.pde</code> files, one may edit or create new schemes.
                    <p>Don't ask why, but there's also a mode that randomizes your controls every so often.</p>
